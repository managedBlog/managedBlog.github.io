## Welcome to the Managed Modern Endpoint blog, v. 2.0

Hello! My name is Sean Bulger. I am a consulting engineer in Enterprise Mobility and Security.

I have been working with Microsoft Endpoint Manager (in all of its various names and iterations) since some time in 2015. I have worked in various fields over the years - ranging from plumber to paramedic before finally finding my way back into technology in 2014. 

I have developed a passion for endpoint management, and believe that endpoint managers can help to drive organizational change in the modern workplace.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I am in the process of migrating my blog from another platform, so if things look a bit rough feel free to shoot me a message on Twitter ([@managed_blog](https://twitter.com/managed_blog)). I promise to fix issues as I am able!
