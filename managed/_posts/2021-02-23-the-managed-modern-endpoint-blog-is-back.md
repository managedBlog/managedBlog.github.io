Welcome back!
 
I know that it has been a while since I last posted a blog entry. The break wasn’t because I didn’t have ideas, nor because I didn’t want to blog. When I started the Managed Modern Endpoint blog at the end of 2019, I had grand plans for what I wanted to accomplish. I thought writing two new posts a week would be easy and hoped that I would be able to leverage that content to find speaking opportunities. My plan was to supercharge my personal development and engage with the Endpoint Manager community.

Early on, the returns were obvious. I was gaining Twitter followers and my blog saw a modest, but steady, audience. Two blog posts a week proved to be a greater challenge than I expected, but everything else fell into place. By the end of March, I had my first open invitation to speak at a user group and my content was improving. ​

There are a dozen cliches I could insert here about 2020, and no matter which one I choose, the message is the same. Plans changed. Working remotely posed a new set of challenges. Our house didn’t have a dedicated workspace. The end of the workday wasn’t well defined. Suddenly working on a personal blog felt too much like the work I was doing for eight or more hours a day. Eventually, I moved my rudimentary workspace down to our unfinished basement – and that quickly led to a new project.
​If you follow me on Twitter you may have seen photos of my basement project. The "Endpoint Enclave" became my pandemic project and nearly all my free time went to finishing the basement. I framed walls, installed flooring, tiled a shower, and nearly every other task you can think of. My time disappeared into the basement, and while the result is amazing, it did keep me away from blogging.
 
That project proved to be very cathartic. Chances are that our world will never return to what we once thought of as “normal.” Transitioning to the latest paradigm meant that I needed something to help me bridge the gap. Finishing the basement gave me both a dedicated workspace and an opportunity to adjust to working remotely. I have learned how to separate my job from my personal life, and I am ready to dive back into blogging.
 
So now here I am. The Managed Modern Endpoint blog has returned. The last year has taught me to slow down, savor the moment, and do what I truly enjoy. Blogging is something I enjoy. Your hobbies should never feel like work, and by stepping away I have been able to redefine my goals and make sure that my heart is in all the content I create. Personal development is important to me, but not at the expense of my sanity. Now I feel much more prepared to approach my blog in a way that is healthy and fulfilling.
 
I already have a lot of great content planned. You will see a lot of familiar topics being covered in future posts. My next article will revisit my earlier series on Impostor Syndrome and discuss how remote work changes how we feel about ourselves. Readers should continue to expect posts that talk about the concept behind modern workplace technologies and, of course, deep technical content on unified endpoint management.
 
Thank you all for your patience. I am excited to be back and look forward to sharing exciting new content!
